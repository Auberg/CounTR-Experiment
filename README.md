## CounTR-Experiment
This is an attemp to replicate and amke the code form the CounTR project to work [[GitHub Repo]](https://github.com/Verg-Avesta/CounTR/tree/main).

Official PyTorch implementation for CounTR. Details can be found in the paper.
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13721) [[Project page]](https://verg-avesta.github.io/CounTR_Webpage/)

You can download the weight from the CounTR project page, and the FSC147 dataset from its original project(link can also be found in the CounTR project page).

### To Do
* Create Object counter for the density map to generate the total object detected
* Test pretraining the model.
