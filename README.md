## CounTR-Experiment
This is an attemp to replicate and amke the code form the CounTR project to work [[GitHub Repo]](https://github.com/Verg-Avesta/CounTR/tree/main).

Official PyTorch implementation for CounTR. Details can be found in the paper.
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13721) [[Project page]](https://verg-avesta.github.io/CounTR_Webpage/)

Thanks to @tamnguyenvan, now we can use CounTR in an easier way by using this [library](https://github.com/tamnguyenvan/vision-counter)!
